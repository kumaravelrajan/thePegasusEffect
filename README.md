# The Pegasus Effect

![Header](images/header.png)

## Introduction

Pegasus is a smartphone spyware developed by the Israeli technological firm NSO group. The Citizen Lab described it as the "most sophisticated cyber weapon ever discovered". 

In 2020, around 50,000 phone numbers believed to have been victims of Pegasus surveillance were leaked to the French NGO Forbidden Stories. A team of journalists began investigating these numbers.

It was found that the list contained opposition politicians, activists and around 200 journalists from nearly two dozen countries along with 14 head of states. Pegasus has also been linked to the murder of Saudi journalist [Jamal Khashoggi](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/press-release/2021/07/the-pegasus-project/).

As part of the revelations, Forbidden Stories posted detailed profiles of 44 victims of Pegasus on their website. Our project is focused on these 44 individuals. We aim to visualize how Pegasus victims reacted to the fact that they were being spied upon by analyzing their online activity.
