I have contributed a chapter in the book on International Affairs Reporting drawing from my experiences in various newsrooms spanning across 18 years. It was a learning experience for me too and I am thankful for the opportunity. The whole idea is to provide students of journalism with a practical and resourceful tool kit to understand the multi layers of reporting and specialization on niche areas and specific beats as they brace up for the real world of news. The editors have put together a team of seasoned journalists from diverse backgrounds. Please do help spread the word and look out for the launch event soon!",

        "title": "My intervention last night on the Mirror Now debate following Prime Minister Modi‚Äôs scathing words about the failures of United Nations Today. Most of the criticisms are justified. But I disagreed with my fellow panelist and noted strategic expert Mahroof Raza who argued that India should give an ultimatum and walk out of he UN if urgent reforms do not take place.\nThe world definitely needs to imagine alternate structures which are more representative of changed realities and reformed, but now is not the time to throw the baby with the bath water. Built on the ruins of the Second World War, UN needs to introspect and course correct to get past and existential crisis staring at it. But in the absence of alternate mechanisms it still serves several useful purposes. Let us also not forget that India‚Äôs share of the UN budget is only 0.7 percent (China-8, Japan-10 and US-22%). You would need the economy to get back on track to dig deeper into your pockets and lead world bodies in addition to the several key contributions India is credited with.",

But at this stage following the constitutional amendment that PM Oli has gone through with playing the nationalism card, PM #Modi will not be coerced to the Dialogue table any time soon now. For now New Delhi will remain focussed on the #LAC situation and a stalemate will continue in ties with Kathmandu. Jingoism and rhetoric can help with domestic point scoring but can never be effective Foriegn policy tools.\nOne can only hope that the technical cooperation and development projects continue with consistency to help tide over this rough patch in relations. For now Delhi will wait to see how things play out internally for #Nepal PM amid an ongoing power struggle.",
